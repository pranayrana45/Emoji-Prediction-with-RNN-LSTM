# Emoji-Prediction-with-RNN-LSTM
In this project, I have trained a deep learning model to predict a suitable emoji according to a given sentence.<br/>
Algorithm Used :- RNN/LSTM<br/>
Accuracy:- 64.28%
## About Dataset
The input dataset consist of text data consiting of different sentences along with the labels. Labels represent a particular emoji.<br/>
We have--><br/>
1) train_emoji.csv - for training our model<br/>
2) test_emoji.csv - for testing our model<br/>
## Additional Files
 I have used the 6B 50D glove vector for Word Embedding.<br/>
